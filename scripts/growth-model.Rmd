steps took for modeling 

1) load librarys: brms etc. 

2) format the data, 4 time points for 166 individuals, plot by individual ID, look at the raw data 

3) set up gompertz fomula using bf(), do a summary on the data, and using summary stats as the starting prior for model fit. normal distribution 

4) varying Hmax, k, and I, fixed Hmin for individuals, random effect, sigma, cauchy... 

5) plot fit curve, observed VS. expected, growth model curve, SSR, CV: K-fold CV Data are randomly partitioned into K subsets of equal size. Then the model is refit 10 times(default), each time leaving out one of the 10 subsets; AIC: bayesian criteria for assess model fit
